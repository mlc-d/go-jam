If you spot any bug, or if you want to add new features or update the project to keep up with the latest developments in its base libraries, please proceed to:

1. **Clone the repo:** [Link](https://gitlab.com/mlc-d/jam) **Please use the GitLab repository**. Even though there's a mirror in GitHub, it's not used to receive contributions.

2. Make your changes. There's no strict code style, but it'd be appreciated if you can try to mimic the rest of the code.

3. Add tests.

4. Send a merge request.

I greatly appreciate all of your feedback.
